# GARCH-vs-NGARCH-Option-Pricing-under-Historical-Calibration
This project implements and compares GARCH(1,1) and NGARCH volatility models for Monte Carlo pricing of European options. The focus is on understanding how asymmetric volatility dynamics affect the risk-neutral distribution of terminal prices and option payoffs, rather than on forecasting realised outcomes.
